# PharmaChain

## Overview
**PharmaChain** is a full-stack platform that enhances pharmaceutical supply chain traceability using **Blockchain**, **IoT**, and **Artificial Intelligence**. It ensures secure, transparent tracking of pharmaceutical products from manufacturing to distribution to pharmacies, addressing critical issues such as:

- Counterfeiting
- Environmental non-compliance
- Lack of transparency

The system integrates:
- **Blockchain (Ethereum):** Immutable data recording and smart contract automation.
- **IoT (Node-RED):** Real-time environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, etc.).
- **AI:** Anomaly detection and certificate validation with 96% accuracy.
- **Web and Mobile Interfaces:** For manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and end-users.

PharmaChain creates digital twins for each pharmaceutical product, enabling lifecycle tracking with cryptographic proof of authenticity, compliant with regulations like Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Good Distribution Practice (GDP).

## Features
- **Traceability:** Tracks drugs from manufacturing to dispensing with blockchain-based immutability.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** IoT sensors collect real-time temperature, humidity, and location data.
- **Fraud Detection:** AI validates certificates and detects anomalies.
- **User Interfaces:**
  - Web platform for manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies.
  - Mobile app for end-users to verify product authenticity and history.
- **Decentralized Storage:** IPFS for secure, distributed data storage.
- **Scalability & Security:** Modular architecture ensures performance and data integrity.

## Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2fb4e47-ae31-4c26-b673-3ce215c94efb)

PharmaChain’s modular architecture separates presentation, business logic, middleware, and storage layers for maintainability and scalability. Key components include:

### Frontend
- **Web Platform:** Built with **React.js**, **Vite**, and **Material Tailwind**. Integrates **MetaMask** via **Web3.js** for secure blockchain transactions.
- **Mobile App:** Developed using **React Native**, **Zustand** for state management, and **Expo** for cross-platform compatibility.

### Backend
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum with **Solidity smart contracts** for recording supply chain events.
- **IPFS:** Decentralized storage for documents and sensor data using Content Identifiers (CIDs).
- **IoT Integration:** **Node-RED** simulates and manages IoT sensor data (temperature, humidity, location).
- **Middleware:** Includes event listeners for real-time blockchain updates, synchronization services, and an IPFS gateway.
- **AI Module:** Machine learning models for real-time anomaly detection and certificate validation.
- **Authentication:** Role-based access control via Ethereum addresses, managed through MetaMask.

For a detailed architecture, refer to *Figure 3.1* in the project report.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher)
- **npm** (v6.x or higher)
- **Truffle Suite**: For smart contract deployment
- **MetaMask**: Browser extension for Ethereum wallet integration
- **Node-RED**: For IoT data simulation
- **Ganache**: For local Ethereum blockchain testing
- **Expo CLI**: For mobile app development
- A running **Ethereum blockchain** (local or testnet) and **IPFS node**

## Installation and Setup
Place both `pharmachain-web` and `pharmachain-mobile` directories in the same parent folder.

### Web Platform Setup
1. Navigate to the web project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pharmachain-web
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install lucide-react @material-tailwind/react web3
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Deploy smart contracts:
   Ensure Truffle is configured with your Ethereum network (e.g., Ganache or testnet).
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```
5. Export smart contract ABI:
   ```bash
   node scripts/exportABI.js
   ```
   This script copies the ABI to the user project.
6. Access the web interface:
   Open `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite) in your browser.

### Mobile App Setup
1. Navigate to the mobile project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pharmachain-mobile
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @expo/vector-icons @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @react-navigation/native expo-blur expo-constants expo-font expo-haptics expo-image expo-image-picker expo-linear-gradient expo-linking expo-location expo-splash-screen expo-status-bar expo-symbols expo-system-ui expo-web-browser lucide-react-native nativewind zustand --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
3. Start the mobile app:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
4. Access the mobile app:
   Use the Expo Go app on your iOS/Android device or an emulator to scan the QR code generated by Expo.

### IoT Integration with Node-RED
1. Install Node-RED:
   Follow the official [Node-RED installation guide](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/).
2. Start Node-RED:
   ```bash
   node-red
   ```
3. Configure IoT data flow:
   - Create a flow to simulate IoT sensor data (temperature, humidity, location) every 1 minute.
   - Connect the flow to the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS for data storage.
   - Associate sensor data with box-specific blockchain addresses.
   - Refer to *Figure 3.3* in the project report for the Node-RED data flow configuration.

## Usage
PharmaChain supports four main actors:

### Manufacturer
- **Create Batches**: Enter batch details, raw materials, and certificates via the web interface (*Figure 5.6*). Invalid certificates trigger an alert (*Figure 5.7*).
- **Enter Environmental Data**: Manually input conditions like temperature and humidity.
- **Confirm Transactions**: Use MetaMask to validate batch creation and unit assignments (*Figures 5.9, 5.10, 5.11*).

### Distributor
- **Link IoT Sensors**: Associate boxes with IoT devices via the web interface (*Figure 5.12*).
- **Monitor Environmental Data**: Node-RED generates data every minute, stored on IPFS and anchored to the blockchain.

### Pharmacy
- **Link IoT Sensors**: Associate boxes with IoT devices (*Figure 5.13*).
- **Record Sales**: Mark medications as sold and update blockchain records.
- **Monitor Conditions**: Access real-time environmental data for received batches.

### End-User
- **Verify Authenticity**: Scan a product QR code using the mobile app (*Figure 5.15*).
- **View Details**: Access product history, including manufacturer, batch number, production date, and environmental conditions (*Figure 5.16*).
